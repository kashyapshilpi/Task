In the first task, we used Python to solve the problem, and all the code is stored in a Python script called 'scripts.py.' To run the script, simply use the command 'python3 scripts.py' in the command line. The output is saved in 'output_entrez.gmt.'

For the second task, we employed a shell script using the command 'task2.sh.' Subsequently, we utilized 'plot.R' to generate the plot. The output is stored in 'genes_per_chromosome_plot.pdf.'

In the third task, we utilized a shell script command stored in 'task3.sh.'
